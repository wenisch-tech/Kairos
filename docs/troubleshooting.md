# Troubleshooting

This page lists common issues and fast fixes for Kairos deployments.

## Startup and Access

### Application does not start

Symptoms:

- Process exits immediately
- Spring Boot startup fails with datasource or migration errors

Checks:

1. Confirm Java version is 17+:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
2. Confirm configuration values are present and valid:
   - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`
   - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`
   - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`
3. Review startup logs for `Flyway`, `datasource`, or `bind` errors.

Typical fixes:

- Use a valid datasource URL for your database type.
- Ensure the DB user can connect and has schema permissions.
- Verify no other process already uses port `8080`.

### H2 database fails with "Chunk not found"

Symptoms:

- Startup or queries fail with `org.h2.mvstore.MVStoreException: Chunk <n> not found`
- Errors mention `General error` on a `select ... from check_result ...` statement

This means the H2 file store under the data directory (`kairos.mv.db`) is physically damaged.
Kairos itself keeps starting when this happens, so the UI and `/actuator/health` stay reachable,
but every query that touches a damaged page keeps failing. The file cannot be repaired in place.

Checks:

1. Confirm only one process uses the database file. Two writers on one `kairos.mv.db` corrupt it:
   - Kubernetes: `replicaCount` must stay `1`, and rollouts must not run two pods on the volume
     (the chart uses the `Recreate` strategy when `persistence.enabled=true`).
   - Docker: never point two containers at the same data volume.
   - Do not add `AUTO_SERVER=TRUE` to a containerized `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`.
2. Confirm the data volume is not full:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -n kairos deploy/kairos -- df -h /app/data
   ```
3. Confirm the volume is block or local storage. H2 file locking is unreliable on NFS/SMB shares.
4. Confirm the container is stopped with SIGTERM and given time to shut down
   (`terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, no `docker kill`).

Typical fixes:

- Restore `kairos.mv.db` from the most recent backup.
- If no backup exists, try to salvage the readable rows with the H2 recovery tool, then import the
  script into an empty database:
  ```bash
  java -cp h2-*.jar org.h2.tools.Recover -dir /app/data -db kairos
  ```
  `Recover` writes `kairos.h2.sql` next to the database. Rows in damaged chunks are lost.
- As a last resort, stop Kairos, move the damaged files aside, and let it start with an empty
  database (Flyway recreates the schema; monitoring history is lost):
  ```bash
  mv /app/data/kairos.mv.db /app/data/kairos.mv.db.corrupt
  ```
- For setups where the history matters, move to PostgreSQL. See
  [Database](configuration-database.md).

### Web UI is unreachable

Symptoms:

- Browser cannot connect to `http://localhost:8080`
- Connection timeout from outside container/cluster

Checks:

1. Verify Kairos is running and listening on 8080.
2. For Docker, confirm port mapping:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
3. For Kubernetes, confirm service and pod health:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n kairos
   kubectl get svc -n kairos
   ```

Typical fixes:

- Add or correct Docker port mapping (`-p 8080:8080`).
- Use `kubectl port-forward -n kairos svc/kairos 8080:8080` for local access.
- Check ingress host/path rules if using ingress.

## Authentication and Login

### Cannot log in as admin

Symptoms:

- Invalid credentials message on login page

Checks:

1. Verify you are using the expected account and password.
2. If this is first startup, try default admin credentials from quickstart.
3. Confirm OIDC settings are correct if OIDC is enabled.

Typical fixes:

- Correct misconfigured OIDC environment variables.
- Disable OIDC temporarily to validate local login behavior.
- Recreate environment with known credentials if this is a disposable setup.

### API requests return 401/403

Symptoms:

- `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` for protected endpoints

Checks:

1. Verify endpoint access requirements in [api.md](api.md).
2. If using API key JWT, ensure header is correct:
   - `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
3. For session auth, include CSRF token for write operations.

Typical fixes:

- Regenerate API key in Admin -> API Keys.
- Use an admin account/key for admin-only endpoints.
- Include CSRF token for `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` with session auth.

## Monitoring and Check Results

### Resource always shows unknown or stale status

Symptoms:

- Resource remains unknown (`-1`) or does not refresh

Checks:

1. Verify resource type interval and parallelism in Admin -> Resource Types.
2. Trigger a manual check from the resource detail page.
3. Confirm target endpoint or registry is reachable from Kairos runtime network.

Typical fixes:

- Lower interval or increase parallelism for busy environments.
- Fix DNS, firewall, or proxy restrictions.
- Correct invalid target URL/image references.

---

### Resource URL is not visible on dashboard/detail page

Symptoms:

- Public users only see resource names, not full target URLs

Checks:

1. Open **Admin -> General Settings**.
2. Verify whether **Always display URL** is enabled.
3. Verify whether you are authenticated.

Expected behavior:

- Authenticated users and admins always see URLs.
- Public users only see URLs when **Always display URL** is enabled.

---

### Resource page fails with outage-related error

Symptoms:

- Resource detail page returns server error when active outages exist
- Logs include `NonUniqueResultException` or "Query did not return a unique result"

Checks:

1. Confirm whether multiple active outages exist for the same resource.
2. Review outage table entries for duplicate active periods.

Typical fixes:

- Upgrade to a version that includes duplicate active outage normalization.
- Ensure outage thresholds are configured sensibly in **Admin -> Resource Types**.
- If needed, clean up legacy/invalid outage rows directly in the database backup copy before restart.

### HTTP resource fails with TLS errors

Symptoms:

- Certificate or hostname validation errors

Checks:

1. Validate certificate chain and hostname externally.
2. Confirm target URL uses the expected certificate.

Typical fixes:

- Use valid certificates in production.
- For internal/self-signed setups, enable `skipTLS` only if acceptable for your risk profile.

---

### Docker resource fails although image exists

Symptoms:

- Docker resource marked unavailable
- Pullability-related errors

Checks:

1. Confirm image reference format and tag/digest.
2. Review credential matching rules in [authentication.md](authentication.md).
3. Review registry pullability behavior in [docker-pullability.md](docker-pullability.md).

Typical fixes:

- Add or correct Docker credentials for registry scope.
- Ensure token has `pull` permission.
- Disable `skipTLS` unless required; if required, verify registry cert setup.

---

## Data and Import/Export

### YAML import skips resources

Symptoms:

- Import summary shows skipped entries

Checks:

1. Validate YAML structure and required fields.
2. Ensure `resourceType` and `target` are valid.
3. Review format details in [importexport.md](importexport.md).

Typical fixes:

- Export first from a working instance and use that file as template.
- Correct unknown resource types or malformed entries.

---

## Metrics and Observability

### Prometheus cannot scrape metrics

Symptoms:

- Scrape target down
- Missing `kairos_resource_status` series

Checks:

1. Verify endpoint is reachable:
   - `/actuator/prometheus`
2. Verify scrape config `metrics_path` is `/actuator/prometheus`.
3. Confirm network policy/firewall allows access.

Typical fixes:

- Correct Prometheus target/port/path.
- Expose actuator endpoint through service/ingress as needed.

---

## Upgrade Issues

### Problems after upgrading Kairos

Checks:

1. Read startup logs for Flyway migration errors.
2. Confirm database backup exists.
3. Validate all runtime env vars after deployment update.

Typical fixes:

- Roll back to previous image/version if startup fails.
- Resolve migration prerequisites, then redeploy.
- Re-apply working configuration values.

## Collect Useful Debug Information

Before opening an issue, collect:

1. Kairos version/tag and deployment method (source, Docker, Helm)
2. Relevant startup/runtime log excerpts
3. Database type (H2/PostgreSQL)
4. Sanitized configuration values
5. Exact failing endpoint/resource target and error message
